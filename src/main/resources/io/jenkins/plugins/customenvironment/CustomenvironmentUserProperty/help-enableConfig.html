    <p> Custom environment variables </p>

    <p> You can customize a global environment variable, and each user can customize an environment variable </p>

        <b>g_key</b> to get the <b>key means a custom key</b></p>

    <p> If it's a password-type value, you print it in code and replace it with **********</p>.

    <p> If you use the Generic Webhook Trigger to Trigger the build task, you can set Cause, in the format [value]. Value will match all the environment variables set by the user to find the corresponding user, and then use all the environment variables found by the user </p>.
